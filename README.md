# footy
Footy is a web-based football/soccer game where the action is represented by simple ASCII graphics. It can be played vs the computer or another online player.

The playing field is divided into sections 7 cells wide and 6 cells long. If it were represented by an ASCII grid from a birds eye view, it would look like this:

[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]


There are 2 goals on the field for each side in the middle of the field at the top and the bottom, similar to soccer.


If a goal is scored, the game restarts at the center cell.
